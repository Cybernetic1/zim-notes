__Reverse SSH TUNNEL__

ssh hana@localhost -p 10001


__=====VPN=====__

First tried the program pptpd as server (said to be the easiest), but it didn't work (ifconfig cannot see the tunnel).

Then I use OpenVPN, following this web page to set up server side:
https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-an-openvpn-server-on-ubuntu-14-04

Except that at the end I need to start the server via:
	sudo openvpn --config server.ovpn
instead of:
	service openvpn restart
The reason for this is unknown.

To edit server configuration details:
	leafpad server.conf

sudo ufw allow 8080
sudo ufw status

On the client side needs:
	client1.crt,  client1.key,  ca.crt
use this to transfer to client computer:
	scp xxxx yky@xxx.xxx.xxx:/home/yky

To start the client:
	sudo openvpn hasee2.ovpn 

But anyway, this no longer works in China because OpenVPN is blocked.
