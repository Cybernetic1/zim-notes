__Neural paradigm:__
genes = NN weights
NN weights = ? 

NN recognizes classes
classes ≈ new knowledge ≈ new formulas
NN weights ≈ how to recognize classes ≈ rules / operators

therefore, genes encode ≈ NN weights ≈ rules / operators

__Logic paradigm:__
genes = formulas

__Main plan__

1. What is distributive representation?
2. How to represent products?
3. What is the dynamic logic?
4. What is the distance metric / norm?
5. Learning algorithm

//Key question://  how does the learning algorithm make use of distance metric?

Gradient may exist but there may be a lot of local minima.

New question.  Even if we have the gradient, local minima and plateaux may still make the technique useless.

We need a structure that is able to record [infinitesimal] changes.
