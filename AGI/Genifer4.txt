KB = sum of products = formal series

matching = rule x KB â†’ KB'

application = KB := KB + KB'

deduction = iterate ( matching + apply )

Learning = hierarchical organization of rules, hierarchical search
	answer:  cone
	need automatic cone organization
	the basis may be based on:
		syntax (?)
		semantics ( aRb, Liebniz extensionality, etc )

__Need:__  NL
	NL is not a correspondence or isomorphism, but rather a complex behavioral response that has to be learned

The question is how to learn the NL perception-response behavior.   It seems to be complex on many levels.

We need some kind of all-encompassing learning.   This can be based on syntax and hand-written semantic rules (where "is-a" is treated as an ordinary relation).
